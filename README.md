# Dementia-Memory
A nonsense memory game for Android.<br>
You can build it with AndroidStudio or find the APK in the app folder.<br>
<br>
This is a fun project. Let's play memory with just ONE! pair of cards!!!<br>
You can chose one of three difficulty levels:<br>
Easy (Heavy dementia mode) - one of the two cards is already disclosed :-D - should be solvable<br>
Difficult (Dementia mode) - both cards are undisclosed ;-) - hmm, difficult, but give it a shot<br>
Impossible (Wise guy mode) - you will be surprised... - let me know if you solved it<br>
<br>
The background is serious:<br>
Most people who fall sick with dementia will become depressive when they<br>
notice they repeatedly fail in remembering things and others consistantly<br>
point to this. So every success in a remembering challenge could relieve them,<br>
even and particularly if it is just by kidding.<br>
So take it easy...
